  title:   'New service: UX Consulting'
  content: |-
    Iâ€™ve been working and writing about computer interfaces at least since 2010. In 2017 I with my friends founded Grumpy.Website, where we write about UI daily. Starting today, YOU can get access to this deep pool of knowledge and expertise. For a small sum of money, I can review your app, site or prototype and write down as many problems as I can find. I can also suggest solutions and best practices where needed.
