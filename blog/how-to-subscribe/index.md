Three ways: RSS, Twitter or Patreon.

## RSS

This blog delivers updates via [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). To use it, you need _a reader_.

1. Register at one of the services or install an app. Good list of hosted RSS readers and apps can be found [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/). I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) via web and [Feedly Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly&hl=en_US).
2. Add my blog to the sources. Usually "`tonsky.me`" would work, but if it doesn’t, try this: "`http://tonsky.me/blog/atom.xml`"
3. Enjoy!

This is how my blog looks like in my Feedly account:

## Twitter

You might follow [@nikitonsky](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky) on Twitter, everything I write I announce on Twitter as well.

## Patreon

If Twitter is too much noise for you, [patreon.com/tonsky](https://www.patreon.com/tonsky) would work too. Become a patron and you’ll be notified about all articles and other stuff that I do.
